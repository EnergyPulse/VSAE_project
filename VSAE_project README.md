### **Enabling EdgeAI with Decentralized Processing**

To enhance the CNC machine monitoring system's capabilities, a decentralized EdgeAI network is proposed, consisting of NVIDIA Jetson Nano devices and Raspberry Pis (RPIs). These edge devices will act as localized processors, enabling real-time data analysis and decision-making at the machine or machine tool level. By offloading computational tasks from centralized servers to these edge devices, the system achieves faster response times, reduced latency, and enhanced scalability, making it ideal for industrial environments.

#### **Roles of Edge Devices in the Decentralized Network**

1. **ESP32 as a Data Feeder**  
   The ESP32 microcontroller serves as the primary data acquisition unit, collecting raw acoustic emission (AE) signals and preprocessing them for transmission. These signals, enriched with metadata such as timestamps and sensor identifiers, are then forwarded to nearby Jetson Nanos or RPIs for further processing.

2. **NVIDIA Jetson Nano: Advanced AI Processing**
   The NVIDIA Jetson Nano is designated for computationally intensive tasks requiring GPU acceleration, such as:  
   - **Anomaly Detection Models**: Jetson Nanos will run AI models (e.g., convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks) trained to detect anomalies in AE signals, such as tool wear patterns, sudden fractures, or machining instabilities. These models process the high-dimensional time-series data to classify machine states in real time.  
   - **Feature Extraction**: The Jetson Nano can extract advanced statistical and frequency-domain features (e.g., spectral entropy, wavelet coefficients) from AE signals to provide deeper insights into the machining process.  
   - **Predictive Maintenance**: Using predictive algorithms, Jetson devices will forecast potential failures or tool replacement intervals based on historical and real-time data.  
   - **Data Aggregation**: In setups with multiple sensors per machine, Jetson Nanos will aggregate data from several ESP32 units, analyzing interactions across sensors to identify correlated events, such as simultaneous tool vibrations and material cracking.

3. **Raspberry Pi: Lightweight Data Analysis**
   Raspberry Pis, being cost-effective and energy-efficient, are best suited for less computationally demanding tasks, including:  
   - **Data Preprocessing**: RPIs can perform basic preprocessing tasks such as signal smoothing, noise reduction, and bandpass filtering of AE data before sending it to Jetson Nanos or centralized storage.  
   - **Event Detection**: Lightweight algorithms on RPIs can identify significant events, such as sudden spikes in acoustic signals, which may indicate potential tool collisions or surface defects. These events are flagged and sent to the Jetson Nano for deeper analysis.  
   - **Micro-Region Monitoring**: At the machine tool level, RPIs monitor localized behaviors such as spindle vibration or cutting temperature, complementing the Jetson Nanoâ€™s global analysis at the machine level.  
   - **Edge Visualization**: Simple dashboards or alerts can be generated on RPIs for immediate operator feedback, displaying key metrics such as AE signal amplitude or anomaly scores.

#### **Example Use Cases**

- **Tool Wear Monitoring**  
   - **Jetson Nano**: Processes time-series AE data to classify the wear stage of a cutting tool (e.g., normal, intermediate, or critical wear). Advanced AI models analyze high-frequency patterns and predict remaining tool life.  
   - **RPI**: Identifies rapid changes in AE amplitude that may indicate sudden tool chipping and sends an alert to the Jetson Nano for confirmation.

- **Surface Defect Detection**  
   - **Jetson Nano**: Detects surface defects such as scratches or cracks by analyzing high-resolution AE signals and correlating them with spindle speed and cutting force data.  
   - **RPI**: Monitors sensor data from a specific region of the workpiece and flags irregularities for further Jetson Nano analysis.

- **Machining Instability Detection**  
   - **Jetson Nano**: Identifies chatter or vibrations indicative of unstable machining conditions using spectral analysis of AE signals.  
   - **RPI**: Monitors spindle-specific data to provide localized information about instability origins.

- **Distributed Data Storage and Synchronization**  
   - Jetson Nanos handle larger datasets and perform periodic synchronization with central servers, whereas RPIs serve as local buffers for smaller, real-time datasets.

#### **Communication and Integration**
The decentralized network employs a hierarchical communication structure:  
- **ESP32 to RPI**: Data is streamed from ESP32 units to nearby RPIs via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  
- **RPI to Jetson Nano**: Processed or flagged data is sent to the Jetson Nano over a local Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection.  
- **Jetson Nano to Cloud**: Aggregated and analyzed data is transmitted to a cloud server or a central database (e.g., InfluxDB) for long-term storage and advanced analytics.

#### **Advantages of the Decentralized Approach**
- **Scalability**: Additional machines or sensors can be easily integrated by deploying more Jetson Nanos and RPIs.  
- **Fault Tolerance**: If one node fails, others can continue processing, ensuring system reliability.  
- **Reduced Latency**: On-site data processing enables real-time decision-making, crucial for anomaly detection and immediate corrective actions.  
- **Energy Efficiency**: Using RPIs for lighter tasks minimizes energy consumption while reserving Jetson Nanos for high-performance AI processing.
